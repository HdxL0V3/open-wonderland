-ology: The suffix ology is commonly used in the English language to denote a field of study.

The ology ending is a combination of the letter o plus logy in which the letter o is used as an interconsonantal letter which, for phonological reasons, precedes the morpheme suffix logy. Logy is a suffix in the English language, used with words originally adapted from Ancient Greek ending in -λογία (-logia).
